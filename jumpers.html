    <h1>Motor Shield Jumpers and Headers</h1>
    <p>There are a two sets of headers on the Wicked Device Motor Control Shield.  The first
       of these is a strip of 9 rows of 2 columns each located near the analog input pins on
       the Arduino Uno board.  The second is a strip of 13 rows with three columns located over the 
       digital pins on the Arduino Uno microcontroller.  For purposes of documentation the side with
       analog input pins will be referenced as the left side of the board and the side with the
       digital pins will be referenced as the right side of the board.</p>

            If the jumper is in place, the current sensor for
            the given motor (M1..M6) is connected to the corresponding analog
            input pin (A0..A5)..  Since the MOTO4 only supports four motors, it
            does not have jumpers on the rows for the M5 and M6

    <p>According to the user's manual, the row of 13 pins closest to the edge of the card is the top
       row and the row furthest from the edge of the card is the bottom row.

              is attached to 5 volts supplied by the Arduino.  The top pin is
              then attached to the PWM digital output pin from the Arduino.

              WildFire v3 microcontroller</a>.<br /><br />
              If the shield is used with the Arduino Uno board, the jumpers should connect
              the middle pin to the bottom pin.  For using the alternate pin locations for
              WildFire microcontroller, the jumpers should connect the middle pin to the
              top pin.  All five jumpers in this set should be connected in the same way.</td></tr>

              with radio control receivers.  The bottom pin of each set is connected to ground.  The
              user's manual says that the middle pin is connected to 5V.  If the BEC is attached,
              the middle pin supplies 5 volts.  If the BEC jumper is missing, no power is 
              supplied to the middle pin.  The top bin is then connected to a pin on the Arduino Uno or
              WildFire microcontroller.
