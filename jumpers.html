    <h1>Motor Shield Jumpers and Headers</h1>
    <p>There are a two sets of headers on the Wicked Device Motor Control Shield.  The first
       of these is a strip of 9 rows of 2 columns each located near the analog input pins on
       the Arduino Uno board.  The second is a strip of 13 rows with three columns located over the 
       digital pins on the Arduino Uno microcontroller.  For purposes of documentation the side with
       analog input pins will be referenced as the left side of the board and the side with the
       digital pins will be referenced as the right side of the board.</p>

            power from the motor shield will be passed to the
            Arduino Uno.</td></tr>

        <td rowspan="2">This may be a means of extending power connections on Arduino Uno
            to other components.  I have not been able to find any information on
            these rows of the header strip.</tr>

            analog input pin on Arduino Uno.  <br />
            If the jumper is in place, the current sensor for
            the given motor (M1..M6) is connected to the corresponding analog
            input pin (A0..A5)..  Since the MOTO4 only supports four motors, it
            does not have jumpers on the rows for the M5 and M6
            motors.</td></tr>

      <tr><td>Servo motor</td><td rowspan="6">It appears that servo motors will be connected
              to these rows, but there is little information.  It is possible that that two of the
              pins on each row represent the positive and negative power leads for the servo motor
              and the third is to pass the PWM output to the control lead of the servo.  It is 
              unknown which row is connected to each pin on the Arduino, but it should be possible
              to determine this by experimentation since the only PWM pins are the digital pins
              3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11.</td></tr>
