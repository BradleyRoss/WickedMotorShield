This is the code for the motor shield by Wicked Device.

The following are my questions about the code.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It is assumed that this code applies to both the M\+O\+T\+O4 (4 DC motors) and M\+O\+T\+O6 (6 DC motors). Is this correct, or are any modifications required?
\item What are hard brake and soft brake? Does hard brake refer to dynamic braking where the leads of the DC motor are wired together? Does the setting of the pulse width modulation (P\+WM pin) affect the percentage of the time that the leads are connected? Does soft brake mean that the leads to the DC motor are isolated from grounds and voltage sources.
\item In \mbox{\hyperlink{class_wicked___d_c_motor_a39e60ca4084d3134ec693815fe2154e1}{Wicked\+\_\+\+D\+C\+Motor\+::set\+Brake()}}, the value of the previous value of the direction bit should be copied to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_wicked_motor_shield_aac68eff7dd860f3811be0f290d70c0bc}{Wicked\+Motor\+Shield\+::old\+\_\+dir}} only if the brake bit was previously clear (indicating B\+R\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+O\+FF) and the B\+R\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+H\+A\+RD or B\+R\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+S\+O\+FT condition is the new brake condition. It appears that the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_wicked_motor_shield_aac68eff7dd860f3811be0f290d70c0bc}{Wicked\+Motor\+Shield\+::old\+\_\+dir}} value is currently updated if going from B\+R\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+S\+O\+FT to B\+R\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+H\+A\+RD or from B\+R\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+H\+A\+RD to B\+R\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+S\+O\+FT.
\item It appears that either the brake status should be set to \mbox{\hyperlink{_wicked_motor_shield_8h_ad52174b3c7a0600af22b33b0f180eb67}{B\+R\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+O\+FF}} when the direction is set or no action should be taken if the brake status is not \mbox{\hyperlink{_wicked_motor_shield_8h_ad52174b3c7a0600af22b33b0f180eb67}{B\+R\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+O\+FF}}.
\item Are the alternate pins for use with the Arduino Mega? If the alternate pins are to be used, how is this represented in the position of the the jumpers? Is some other method used to indicate the use of alternate pin locations?
\item Can I use the two RC in pins to provide for two way communication using I2C with another device such as a Bluetooth serial card? Should the configuration of the pins be removed from the constructor since the motor shield library does not use them. The pins would then be configured by the software that communicates with the outside world.
