This is the code for the motor shield by Wicked Device.

The following are my questions about the code.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It is assumed that this code applies to both the M\+O\+T\+O4 (4 DC motors) and M\+O\+T\+O6 (6 DC motors). Is this correct, or are any modifications required?
\item What are hard brake and soft brake? Does hard brake refer to dynamic braking where the leads of the DC motor are wired together? Does the setting of the pulse width modulation (P\+WM pin) affect the percentage of the time that the leads are connected? Does soft brake mean that the leads to the DC motor are isolated from grounds and voltage sources.
