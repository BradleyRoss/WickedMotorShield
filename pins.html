    <h1>Power Connections</h1>
    <h3>External Power to Shield</h3>
        There is a block of six connectors with screw clamp-downs on the motor shield
        for attaching the external power supply that will provide the power for the motors.
        Only the outermost of the terminals are used, with markings of + and - on the 
        circuit board to identify the terminals.
    <h3>Output Terminals</h3>
    <p>Power is supplied to the motors using a row of either 8 (MOTO4) or 12 (MOTO6) 
       connectors with screw clamp-downs for the wires.  There are two connectors for
       each wire with the arrangement of the connectors shown below.  The last four
       connectors (marked 5A, 5B, 6A, and 6B) are not present for the MOTO4 motor shield.</p>

    <p>If the motor is set to drive in the clockwise direction, the A pin has a voltage that is
       positive with respect to the B pin.  If a motor is set to drive in the 
       counter-clockwise direction, the voltage of the B pin is positive with respect
       to the A pin.  It should be noted that the use of clockwise and counter-clockwise
       as used here is based on the convention used by the Wicked Device Motor Shield and
       accompanying software and documentation.</p>
    <p>When dealing with DC motors, if the red lead is positive with respect to the black lead, the
       motor spins in a clockwise direction when viewed from the end when viewed from the end of the
       spindle looking down towards the motor.  Reversing the polarity of the leads reverses the
       direction of rotation.</p>
