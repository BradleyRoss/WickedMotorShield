      <title>Use with Stepper Motors</title>

      <p>This is a discussion of the use of stepper motors such as
         the 28BYJ-48 with Arduino microcontrollers.  OSEPP has provided a 
         < href="https://www.osepp.com/downloads/pdf/stepd-01-data-sheet.pdf" target="_blank">
         wiring diagram of the 28BYJ-48 motor.</a>

      <li><a href="https://www.osepp.com">OSEPP</a> has a page discussing
          <a href="https://www.osepp.com/electronic-modules/breakout-boards/93-stepper-motor-driver">
         the use of the ULN2003A stepper motor board  with the 28BYJ-48 stepper motors.</a>  In
         this case the orange wire is connected to ground and the pink, red, blue, and yellow
         wires are connected to the outputs of the ULN2003A chip.</li>
      <li>The stepper motor can also be used with an Arduino motor control shield such as the
          Wicked Device MOTO-4 or MOTO-6.  The two coils in the motor are connected to the pink/red and blue/yellow
          pairs of wires.  The wires for each coil are connected to a seperate motor output on the board.</li>
