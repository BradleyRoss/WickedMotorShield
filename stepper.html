      <h1>Use with Stepper Motors</h1>
      <p>The Wicked Device Motor Shield is designed for use with bipolar rather than unipolar
         stepping motors.  However,
         some unipolar stepping motors can be wired as bipolar units so long as the center taps
         of the two sets of windings are not connected.</p>
      <p>The user's manual for the motor shield shows three different wirings for stepper motors.
         It should be mentioned that the 6-wire unipolar motor can be used as a 4-wire bipolar 
         motor by simply leaving the center taps (5 and 6) unconnected.</p>
      <p>The 5-wire unipolar configuration is used by the
         <a href="https://www.osepp.com/downloads/pdf/stepd-01-data-sheet.pdf" target="_blank">
         28BYJ-48</a>.  Since this configuration has the 
         center taps connected to each other, it does not seem suitable for use with this board.</p>
      <p>There are a number of ways in which stepper motors can be wired.  One article
         discussing the various schemes 
         <a href="https://42bots.com/tutorials/stepper-motor-wiring-how-to/" target="_blank">
         can be found here</a>.  This article discusses the differences between unipolar and
         bipolar stepper motors, but may require some additional resources in order to understand
         it further.</p>

      <li>STEPPERONLINE ( https://omc-stepperonline.com ) This firm has a wide variety of stepper motors, 
          both unipolar and bipolar stepper motors.  It may be a useful source of data sheets although you
          may want to purchase units through other sources to avoid having to deal with customs.</li>
