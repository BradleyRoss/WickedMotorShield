    <h1>Use with Servo Motors</h1>
    <p>This section discusses the use of Arduino motor control shields such as the
       MOTO-4 and MOTO-6 from Wicked Device in conjunction with
       servo motors.  Although the WickedMotorShield class does not
       include code for servo motors, there is mention of servo
       motors in the packaging of the shield.</p>
